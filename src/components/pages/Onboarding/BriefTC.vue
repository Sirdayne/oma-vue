              the amount received by Mastercard Track, after deduction or withholding for Taxes, equals the full
              amount invoiced. &nbsp;In addition, if requested by Mastercard Track, then you will provide Mastercard
              Track with a tax receipt or other proof of payment for any withholding taxes remitted by you.

              proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the

              (including Company Materials, if applicable) infringes or misappropriates such third party&rsquo;s
              intellectual property or other rights, (2) arising from your (or your Authorized Users&rsquo;, as
              applicable) use of any part of the Service in an unlawful manner, in violation of these Terms or the

            <li><u>Procedure</u>. A party seeking indemnification under this Section must (i) provide the indemnifying
              party prompt written notice of the Claim (provided, however, that failure to give prompt written notice will
              relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations solely to the extent it is materially prejudiced by such
              failure), (ii) give the indemnifying party sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim (except
              that the indemnifying party may not settle any Claim unless it unconditionally releases the indemnified
              party of all liability), and (iii) gives the indemnifying party all reasonable assistance, at the
              indemnifying party&rsquo;s reasonable expense.

              RELEASED PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR IF MASTERCARD TRACK&rsquo;S OR THE
              APPLICABLE RELEASED PARTY&rsquo;S REMEDY OTHERWISE FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.&nbsp; THE FOREGOING
              DISCLAIMER WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW.&nbsp; NO SUPPLIER OF TRADE DIRECTORY DATA WILL BE
              LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THAT SUPPLIER&rsquo;S PROCURING, COMPILING,

              30 days to cure any breach that is capable of cure), (ii) if you appear on any list of sanctioned entities

          <strong>General.</strong>
          <ol>
            <li><u>Updates to the Terms</u>. Mastercard Track may modify these Terms at any time (i) to the extent
              necessary to comply with applicable laws, (ii) to make immaterial changes or other changes that do not
              adversely affect your rights under the Terms, or (iii) if required by our service providers.&nbsp; In any
              case of (i), (ii), or (iii), the modified Terms will become effective upon posting.&nbsp; If Mastercard
              Track makes changes to these Terms that materially or adversely affect your rights under the Terms
              (&ldquo;<u>Adverse Changes</u>&rdquo;), then Mastercard Track will notify you via email that changes to the
              Terms have been made.&nbsp; If you do not agree to the Adverse Changes, then you must terminate these Terms,
              with termination to be effective at the end of the then-current subscription term (provided, that during the
              period of time between notice of termination and the end of the then-current subscription term, you will be
              bound by the Terms in effect immediately prior to the Adverse Changes).&nbsp; If you do not have a
              subscription to the Service, then the Terms will terminate immediately upon your non-acceptance of any
              Adverse Changes.&nbsp; Except as set forth in the immediately preceding two sentences, by continuing to use
              the Service after the effective date of any modifications to these Terms, you agree to be bound by the
              modified Terms.&nbsp; For clarity, if the Principal Owner is notified of Adverse Changes and does not log in
              to the Service to accept the revised Terms within the time period specified in the notice, then the revised
              Terms will be deemed accepted by the Principal Owner.
            </li>

              guidelines applicable to the Service or certain features of the Service that Mastercard Track may post on or

              (&ldquo;<u>Company Statistics</u>&rdquo;).&nbsp; Mastercard Track may use aggregate statistics for any
              purpose.&nbsp; Mastercard Track may use Company Statistics for purposes of sales, marketing, business
              development, product enhancement, or customer service, including to display Company Statistics.
            </li>
            <li><u>Notice</u>. Except as otherwise specified in these Terms, all notices related to these Terms
              (&ldquo;<u>Notices</u>&rdquo;) will be in writing and will be effective upon (i) personal delivery, (ii) by
              an overnight courier delivery service of general commercial use and acceptance (such as DHL, Federal Express
              or UPS), addressed to Mastercard Track at the address set forth in Section 14 below and you at the address
              associated with your account, if any, (iii) if there is no address associated with your account, our posting

              agreements, disclosures or other communications that Mastercard Track sends electronically will satisfy any
              legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.
            </li>
            <li><u>Wrongful Electronic Communications</u>. If you (or any of your Authorized Users, if applicable) receive
              any communication from Mastercard Track that is addressed to a third party or which was wrongfully forwarded
              to you or an Authorized User, if applicable, then you or the Authorized User, as applicable, will notify
              Mastercard Track immediately, return the communication as soon as possible, not use the communication for
              any reason and destroy all copies of the communication.
            </li>
            <li><u>Governing Law</u>. These Terms and the respective rights and obligations of the parties will be
              governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to its
              conflict-of-laws or similar provisions that mandate or permit application of the substantive law of any
              other jurisdiction.&nbsp; Each party submits to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts
              and federal courts located within New York County, New York for resolution of any lawsuit or court
              proceeding permitted under these Terms.
            </li>
            <li><u>Company and Authorized User Dispute Resolution</u>. With respect to you and your Authorized Users, the
              following terms will apply in the event of a dispute.
            </li>
            <li>Upon the occurrence of any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms (&ldquo;<u>Dispute</u>&rdquo;)
              and notice of such Dispute by one party to the other party (pursuant to Section 13.d), the parties will
              attempt to resolve the Dispute promptly by good faith negotiations between the appropriate members of each
              party&rsquo;s management team. If such negotiations do not promptly settle the Dispute, then the Authorized
              User who entered into these Terms on your behalf and Mastercard Track&rsquo;s designee will attempt in good
              faith to resolve the Dispute.&nbsp; If no resolution is reached within thirty (30) days from receipt of the
              initial notice (which time may be extended by mutual agreement), then either party may submit the Dispute to
              binding arbitration.
            </li>
            <li>Any Dispute not resolved pursuant to Section 13.g.i will be finally settled by binding, confidential
              arbitration in New York, New York, conducted in English and administered by the Judicial Arbitration and
              Mediation Services under its International Arbitration Rules in effect on the date of the commencement of
              the arbitration (the &ldquo;<u>Rules</u>&rdquo;). The arbitration proceeding will be administered by three
              (3) arbitrators appointed in accordance with the Rules. Such arbitrator(s) will be fluent in English and
              will have experience as an arbitrator in international finance and will have a good knowledge of the laws of
              the State of New York. All Disputes submitted to the arbitrator(s) will be decided by the arbitrator(s) on
              the basis of the laws of the State of New York and not in the capacity of &ldquo;amiable compositeur&rdquo;.
              The arbitrator(s) are not empowered to award damages in excess of compensatory damages, and each party
              waives any right to recover non-compensatory damages, including, but not limited to, punitive damages with
              respect to any Dispute resolved by arbitration.&nbsp; The award will be final and a reasoned award that
              explains the factual and legal bases for the arbitrator(s)&rsquo; decision.&nbsp; Judgment upon the award
              rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The costs of the
              arbitration will be borne as ordered by the arbitrator(s).&nbsp; Either party may apply to the arbitrator(s)
              seeking injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the Dispute is otherwise resolved.
              Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under this Agreement, seek from any court having
              jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that
              party, pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal. The statute of limitations of the State of New
              York applicable to the commencement of a lawsuit will apply to the commencement of an arbitration hereunder,
              except that no defenses will be available based upon the passage of time during any negotiation called for
              pursuant to Section 13.g.i.
            </li>
            <li><u>Visitor Dispute Resolution</u>. If you are not a Company or an Authorized User, then, the following
              terms will apply in the event of a dispute.
            </li>
            <li><u>Generally</u>. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Mastercard Track in the most
              expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 13.h.ii, you and Mastercard Track
              agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration.
              Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge
              or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by
              courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to
              arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether
              based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of
              whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY
              ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND MASTERCARD TRACK ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
              PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
            </li>
            <li><u>Exceptions</u>. Despite the provisions of Section 13.h.i, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to
              waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (A) bring an individual action in small
              claims court; (B) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if
              that action is available; (C) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (D) to file
              suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
            </li>
            <li><u>Arbitrator</u>. Any arbitration between you and Mastercard Track will be settled under the Federal
              Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;<u>AAA</u>&rdquo;) under
              its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, &ldquo;<u>AAA Rules</u>&rdquo;) as modified by these Terms.
              The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a
                href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting
              Mastercard Track. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
              interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
            </li>
            <li><u>Notice of Arbitration; Process</u>. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written
              notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required)
              or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail
              (&ldquo;<u>Notice of Arbitration</u>&rdquo;). Mastercard Track&rsquo;s address for Notice of Arbitration is
              the address for the Mastercard entity applicable to Your jurisdiction set forth in Section 14. The Notice of
              Arbitration must: (A) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (B) set forth the specific
              relief sought (&ldquo;<u>Demand</u>&rdquo;). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim
              directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of
              Arbitration is received, Visitor or Mastercard Track may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration
              proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.
              During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Mastercard Track must not be
              disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the
              arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Mastercard Track
              in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Mastercard Track will pay you the higher of: (y) the amount
              awarded by the arbitrator; or (z) $10,000.
            </li>
            <li><u>Fees</u>. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, then Mastercard Track will
              reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case
              the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a
              location to be agreed upon in the county in which the Mastercard entity applicable to Your jurisdiction (set
              forth in forth in Section 14) sits, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the
              arbitration will be conducted: (A) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (B) through
              a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (C) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in
              the county (or parish) of your address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or
              the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
              standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed
              by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Mastercard Track for all monies previously disbursed
              by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the
              arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the
              essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may
              make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during
              the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&rsquo;s ruling on
              the merits.
            </li>
            <li><u>No Class Actions</u>. YOU AND MASTERCARD TRACK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY
              IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
              PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Mastercard Track agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
              consolidate more than one person&rsquo;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
              representative or class proceeding.
            </li>
            <li><u>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</u>. If Mastercard Track makes any future change to this
              arbitration provision, other than a change to Mastercard Track&rsquo;s address for Notice of Arbitration,
              you may reject the change by sending Mastercard Track written notice within 30 days of the change to
              Mastercard Track&rsquo;s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case this arbitration provision, as in
              effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
            </li>
            <li><u>Enforceability</u>. If Section 13.h.vi is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section
              13.h is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 13.h will be null and void and, in that
              case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 13.fwill govern any
              action arising out of or related to these Terms.
            </li>
            <li><u>No Agency</u>. The relationship between the parties is that of independent contractors.&nbsp; Neither
              party will represent itself as the agent or legal representative of the other party for any purpose
              whatsoever, and will have no right to create or assume any obligation of any kind, express or implied, for
              or on behalf of the other party in any way whatsoever.&nbsp; These Terms will not create or be deemed to
              create any agency, partnership or joint venture between the parties.
            </li>
            <li><u>Export Compliance</u>. The Service and other technology that Mastercard Track makes available may be
              subject to export laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions.&nbsp; Each party
              represents that it is not named on any U.S. government denied-party list.&nbsp; If you are a Company, then
              you may not permit Authorized Users to access or use the Service in a U.S. embargoed country or in violation
              of any U.S. export law or regulation.
            </li>
            <li><u>Anti-Corruption</u>. The parties recognize that Mastercard Track and any person or entity acting on its
              behalf must comply with international laws related to anti-bribery and corruption (including the US Foreign
              Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and other applicable law).&nbsp; You will comply with, and if you
              are a Company, will ensure that each of your Authorized Users and if so approved or permitted, your
              personnel, subcontractors, agents and/or representatives (collectively, &ldquo;Company Representatives&rdquo;)
              complies with, all applicable anti-bribery and corruption laws applicable to business dealings, including
              with any governmental official and any implementing regulations in respect of such laws. You warrant,
              represent and covenant to Mastercard Track that you (and if you are a Company, each of your Authorized Users
              or Company Representatives) has not, and will not, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
              Agreement or in connection with any other business transactions involving Mastercard Track, make, promise or
              offer to make any payment or transfer of anything of value or other advantage directly or indirectly through
              a representative, intermediary agent or otherwise:&nbsp;(i) to any governmental official; (ii) to any
              political party; or (iii) to any other person for the purpose of improperly influencing any act, omission to
              act or decision of such official, political party or individual or securing an improper advantage to assist
              the parties in obtaining or retaining business. You also warrant, represent and covenant to Mastercard Track
              that you, and if you are a Company, your Authorized Users or Company Representatives, will not, in
              connection with any business activities involving Mastercard Track, accept anything of value from any third
              party seeking to influence any of your acts or decisions or in order to secure an improper advantage to that
              third party.&nbsp; Your failure to comply with the terms of this Section k will constitute a material breach
              of the Agreement.
            </li>
            <li><u>Entire Agreement</u>. These Terms (including any Schedules incorporated into these Terms) are the
              entire agreement between User and Mastercard Track regarding User&rsquo;s use of the Service and supersedes
              all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its
              subject matter.&nbsp; Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, no modification, amendment, or waiver of
              any provision of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the
              modification, amendment or waiver is to be asserted.
            </li>
            <li><u>Assignment</u>. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by
              operation of law or otherwise, without Mastercard Track&rsquo;s prior written consent. Mastercard Track may
              assign any of its rights or obligations under these Terms without your consent.&nbsp; Subject to the
              foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and
              permitted assigns.
            </li>
            <li><u>Waiver; Severability</u>. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under these Terms
              will constitute a waiver of that right.&nbsp; If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of
              competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision will be deemed null and void, and the remaining
              provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.

              in a SWIFT message you authorized.&nbsp; You will indemnify and hold harmless Mastercard Track and its

            <li><strong>Representations and Warranties.</strong> You represent and warrant to Mastercard Track that any

                  requirements implemented by Mastercard Track, (b) Mastercard Track believes that the processing or delivery
                  of that Instruction may place Mastercard Track in breach of any law or regulation, (c) Mastercard Track
                  reasonable suspects that the Instruction may not (i) fully and accurately reflect the intent of You or Your
                  financial counterparty, or (ii) have been given in accordance with Mastercard Track&rsquo;s authorization
